Spring 2022

Our app will provide an ergonomic way for users to simulate playing steel drums on a tablet device. The app will have a database containing music that users can listen to and learn from. Only those with administrator access can add and remove music. The app will also allow users to record themselves playing the steel drums and listen back to recordings. Users will be able to save their information so that data and settings persist between logins.

Client: Matthew Britain, Vanderbilt University Steel Drum Professor

We plan to use a Model View Controller (MVC) framework and a Client/Server framework.

Deployment Instructions: This app is deployed using Heroku CLI. We use Postgres for the application's database. The app can be accessed at this link: https://steeldores.herokuapp.com
